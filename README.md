# Can Coffee Grind Size Impact the Brewing Speed and Bitterness?
This experiment aims to test the effect of coffee grind size on coffee’s brewing speed and the degree of bitterness. I conduct a complete random assignment by assigning 18 units to coarse grinds and 18 units to fine grinds. I measure the brewing time for making 0.68 oz of coffee and collect 3 participants’ ratings of bitterness. My findings suggest that the average dripping time and ratings of bitterness increase significantly when we grind the coffee finer.

### Research Design
This research uses a two-arm design in which the coffee beans are randomly assigned to ground in fine and coarse sizes. Two outcomes are measured in this experiment: the dripping time and
people’s rating of the bitterness of the coffee.
